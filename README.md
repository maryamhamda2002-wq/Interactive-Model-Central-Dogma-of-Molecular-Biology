#Central Dogma Visualization — Python Animation

This project visualizes the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology using Python.  
It demonstrates how genetic information flows from DNA → mRNA → Protein, animated step by step through code.

Description
Built entirely from scratch, this project brings molecular biology to life using Matplotlib.  
It simulates:
-Transcription: Conversion of DNA into mRNA  
-Translation: Conversion of mRNA into a chain of amino acids (protein)  

The goal is to make complex biological concepts interactive, educational, and visually engaging, showing how coding can simplify scientific understanding.

What I Learned
- How to use Matplotlib for scientific plotting and animation  
- Using patches to draw molecules like polymerase, ribosomes, and amino acids  
- Applying FuncAnimation to simulate molecular processes frame by frame  
- Displaying interactive visuals in Jupyter Notebook using `IPython.display.HTML`


Scientific Basis
This model follows the Central Dogma, one of biology’s most fundamental principles.  
It shows how:
1. DNA stores genetic information  
2. mRNA transcribes it  
3. Ribosomes translate it into proteins, the molecules responsible for cell function  

Such visualizations can help in bioinformatics education, molecular biology teaching, and research communication.


Technologies Used
- Python  
- Matplotlib  
- Matplotlib.patches  
- Matplotlib.animation  
- IPython.display (for interactive HTML display)

How to Run
1. Open the `.ipynb` or `.py` file in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code  
2. Run all cells  
3. The animation will appear interactively using `HTML(ani.to_jshtml())`

Future Scope
- Extend animation for replication and mutation visualization  
- Add real codon tables and 3D molecular graphics  
- Use Biopython for deeper biological integration
